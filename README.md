# IP Address Tracker
#### FrontEnd Mentor challenge to build out an IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
#### To get the IP Address locations I used the IP Geolocation API by IPify. To generate the map, I used LeafletJS.
#### You can search IP address (142.250.191.78) or Domain names (google.com)
